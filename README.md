# Sparrow's Theme

This project is a way of learning some basic nix flake in an applied manner. It also attempts to establish a consistent design system for my future projects to build on. It is for my own use principally.

However, I do recommend something like this as a good starter project for using nix. 

## Attribution

Inspired by [Xess](https://github.com/Xe/Xess), both for the idea and execution.

Initial colorscheme is [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest), by Sainnhe.

Livery maps Everforest into a base-16/Tinted Themeing setup, following [this file](https://github.com/tinted-theming/base16-schemes/blob/main/everforest.yaml).

Utility classes are based off of the work of [Heydon Pickering](https://heydonworks.com/) and [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/).

All other design tokens are from [Open Props](https://open-props.style/)
